An apt title I thought, given this is my first post on this site. Traditionally used as a phrase to test the initial output of an application, it felt fitting way to launch my blog and the most recent change in my career.

You see, I've decided to go back to my roots, to start where it all began. I think it's fairly safe to say that I'm taking the road less travelled by most. Typically career trajectories move up and to the right. Not mine. Not now. And for good reason.

I've spent the last couple of decades in "digital", creating and managing web sites, web apps and online products. I started out as a Web Designer, in those days a hybrid role sitting somewhere between graphic design and backend teams. From there I moved into software and delivery management. The combination of which led to my becoming a Engineering Manager, a senior level role with many responsibilites. I had reached my aspirations, but I wasn't happy.

I moved into Product Management. The role has become increasingly popular ove time. The breadth of responsibility, autonomy and the ability to work directly with customers and and stakeholders is very appealing. If hadn't lost my last role to the downturn that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, I'd probably still be there. As luck would have it, that would not be my fate.

I decided to take some time off to spend time with the kids who are remote learning from home. Our youngest having only just started prep needed support. I needed a break from work. It has been a great opportuniuty to bond as a family, prioritise health and wellbeing, and for me, to reflect on my next move.

Reflecting back on my career to date, the things I enjoyed most were working with smart passionate people and building useful things. Over the years, I found myself suffering an existential quandry. Moving into management allowed me to work with people, but it got me further and further away from creating and building. It's not uncommon. Several of my "post-technical" colleagues felt the same way.

So here I am, busily re-learning the skills I let go, and having to learn miriad new ones. Technology doesn't stand still, particularly not on the web. There's so much to learn, and I'm having a blast. My goal is become a full stack JavaScript product developer. It embraces all the things I enjoy about working with people, and designing and building useful things.
