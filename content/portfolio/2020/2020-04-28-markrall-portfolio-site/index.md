The online porfolio is the most basic, relevant tool that any creative, designer or developer, should seriously consider to promote their services. 

[markrall.dev](https://markrall.dev/) is just that, a way to showcase skills as I acquire them and an opportunity to explore  technologies.

<!-- benefits of the JAM stack https://opensource.com/article/20/9/jamstack -->
I selected Gatsby for this project to learn more about the JAM Stack, React and Graphql, while having the benefits of integrated development tooling.

Content is marked up using Markdown, my preferred method for writing content for multiple medium. Mardown suits my workflow. Future iterations of the site may use one of the many (headless CMS solutions)[https://dev.to/integridsolutions/best-serverless-cms-for-2020-27jb] like Contentful, Sanity.io, and Netlify to name a couple. 

The site uses MDX files, markdown that supports JSX, to create dynamic content. Graphql queries to generate unique content types for the blog and portfolio through unique templates for each.

I'm currently completing the best selling [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/8138514#overview) by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/academind/) on Udemy. As I learn more, the more refactoring opportinities I find for the site. Let's just say it's a renovators delight for now.   

I currently use a mix of CSS modules and styled components to style presentation. There are benefits for each. I'd like to pick one. Given their unique advantages I'm not sure that's possible. 

I've integrated, [GetForm.io](https://getform.io/) to provide the contact form functionality using Axios to manage AJAX communication.
