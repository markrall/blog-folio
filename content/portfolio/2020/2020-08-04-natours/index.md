## Summary
Based on the best seller [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/learn/lecture/8312924#overview) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) on Udemy, I wanted to take this course to refresh my skills, that practically speaking, were now a decade old by this point. 

A lot has changed with advancements in the CSS spec, preprocessors and tooling. In completing this course, I wanted to make sure that I had a contemporary understanding of the technology and current practices. 

As the the author mentions during the course, you can learn all this stuff organically over time. But it takes lots of time, and trial and error. I wanted to accelerate my development through focused learning.

There was a lot to learn and re-learn in this section. From fundamentals to more advanced concepts. I had an absolute blast creating my first web page in many, many years. Of course, despite one's best efforts to follow along, mistakes are invariably made. Diagnosing and debugging created some of the biggest learning opportunities.
