## Summary
Based on the best seller [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/learn/lecture/8312924#overview) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) on Udemy, I wanted to take this course to refresh my skills, that practically speaking, were now a decade old by this point. 

A lot has changed with advancements in the CSS spec, preprocessors and tooling. In completing this course, I wanted to make sure that I had a contemporary understanding of the technology and current practices. 

As the the author mentions, you can learn all this stuff organically over time. But it takes lots of time, and trial and error. I wanted to accelerate my development through focused learning.

This section primarily introduced CSS Flexbox and the benefits it provides in styling elements on a single dimension. Headers, navigation, footers and other components like post meta just got a whole lot easier to style! üëåüèª

Using online tools like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) allowed me to break concepts and challenges into discrete untis to explore and understand more deeply.

## Lessons:
- CSS reset and using CSS variables
- Advanced use for Emmet to quickly generate HTML markup
- Deep dive into CSS Flexbox
- Using HTML and CSS SVG assets (individual and sprites)
