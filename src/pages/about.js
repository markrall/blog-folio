          <p>Hi there! I&#8217;m Mark. </p>

          <p>
            I have had a long-term passion for the Internet and the
            opportunities it provides. Over the past two decades I&#8217;ve
            worked in a variety of roles, organisations and on a variety of web
            projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            Early days I worked worked for companies like BT Financial Group,
            Trading Post and REA Group as a front end developer and designer.
            Over time, I had the fortune to work my way up through team lead,
            agile delivery and management roles. Recently I&#8217;ve tried my
            hand at consulting and most recently Product Management.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe in pursuing passion and that results naturally follow.
            I&#8217;ve experienced in myself and in others I&#8217;ve had the
            pleasure to work with. Consistently throughout my career, I&#8217;ve
            experienced a nostalgia for the early days when I was learning
            exciting technologies, solving problems and crafting products.{" "}
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              I most like working with, and learning about, people and software
              to build web products.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            <em>
              "It seems a little weird that you're going back to where you
              started Mark"
            </em>
            , I hear you say. Absolutely! Having a passion for what I do is
            very, VERY important to me.{" "}
            <em>
              Plus, having the background I do, only makes me a more valuable
              asset.
            </em>{" "}
            My only regret is that I didn't recognise or make the move sooner.
          </p>

          <p>
            I&#8217;m committed to the craft that ignited that passion so many
            years ago. The COVID&#8211;19 pandemic has reignited and provided
            the vehicle for me to do so. My goal is to become a full stack
            JavaScript (JS) developer, building web products using modern
            popular technologies.

            Since leaving my last role, I&#8217;ve been reskilling myself on
            HTML, (S)CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Keen to learn as much as I can,
            I&#8217;ve also been studying and applying NodeJS, ReactJS and
            Gatsby. Below is a rough timeline of my journey so far:
